            <p class="highlighted-paragraph">
                In the heart of Codonia, where logic and creativity fuel learning, Nullify spreads its digital plague—warping functions, breaking algorithms, and turning structured data into chaos. This sinister force thrives on bugs, crashes, and infinite loops, seeking to erase the very foundation of programming itself. With the power to corrupt variables and nullify logic, only the bravest coders can stand against its reign.
